    <h1>Kat Food Shop</h1>
    <p>The Brew tea company has a really cool and modern website design. The colors are very muted and earthy, which goes well with the theme of tea. The layout is very clean and easy to navigate. I really like how they have a lot of information on each page, but it is still easy to find what you are looking for.</p>

    Meat & Fish
Meat – what type is entirely up to you. We would recommend skinless white meat such as turkey or chicken as these are considered the healthiest because of the low amount of saturated fat. If you fancy something redder, then try to choose lean cuts.

Luncheon Meat – these are good for popping into sandwiches<br><br><br>

Grains & Bread
Pasta – this is a great basic that’s easy and quick to cook<br><br><br>

Rice – another great meal essential that will fill you up and bulk out your meal<br><br><br>

Bread – great for sandwiches. To get more healthy fiber into your system, you recommend wholemeal or wholegrain varieties.<br><br><br>

All-purpose flour – it’s always good to have some of this around. Not only is it the core ingredient for a cake, but you can also use it as a sauce thickener, or coat meat and other ingredients to give them a crispy finish when frying.

Breakfast cereal – this will help give you a decent start to the day. Try to avoid the more sugary varieties, and opt for ones high in fiber, as this will keep you full for longer. Consider things like unsweetened granola or porridge oats/oatmeal.

Oil & Fat
Cooking oil – you’re going to need this to cook most things. For healthier options, opt for olive oil,l rapeseed oil, or other oils choc full of omega 3.

Butter – if you’re making sandwiches, you’re going to need something to spread on your slices. You’ll also need this if you fancy making a cake.

Dairy & Eggs
Milk – a breakfast essential if you have cereal for breakfast, if prefer your hot drinks a lighter shade of brown, or want to make a sauce. Vegans and the health conscious should check out milk alternatives like soy or almond.

Eggs – these versatile little things are essential ingredients for a cake or can be made many different ways for a quick breakfast or lunch.

Cheese – a great standard sandwich filler or for an ingredient in cheesy side-dishes or main courses


Don’t buy what you don’t need. Stick to the essentials with a shopping list.

Yogurt – use it to mix with fruit or honey for a quick tasty dessert<br><br><br>

Produce
Onions – it’s difficult to imagine a homemade dish that doesn’t utilize these. These keep well in cool dark places and are always good to have a few extra just in case you find yourself doing some extra cooking or having to make bigger portions

Garlic – another essential ingredient in many meals to add flavor<br><br><br>

Fruit – these contain a host of vitamins and fiber that will help you be healthy and maintain an effective immune system. They also serve as great healthy snacks.
<br><br><br>
Vegetables – a great source of vitamins. It’s best to mix as many different colors as possible, as each color of vegetable usually contains different essential vitamins. So, make sure your greens are not all green!
